# ack 2 Unicode support

  - File encoding (what do we do now? what if someone tries an ack UCS-2-file?)
  - ARGV encoding
  - Document new regex-fu that came with 5.14?
  - Filename/pattern normalization
  - Output stream encoding
  - Collation level is something I mentioned
  - I18N::Langinfo
  - Coloration + unicode chars
